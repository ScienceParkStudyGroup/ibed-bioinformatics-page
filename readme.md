# Available software information

Go to https://scienceparkstudygroup.github.io/ibed-bioinformatics-page/ for information about  software that might be useful for bioinformatic data analyses. Please note: This is very much a work in progress and the page will be slowly updated over time.

If you want to add additional information you are welcome to do so. For now, feel free to send an email to <n.dombrowski@uva.nl> with a markdown, quarto or text file with all relevant information and I can integrate this into the webpage.
