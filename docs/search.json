Please note: This is very much a work in progress and the page will be slowly updated over time.\nIf you want to add additional information you are welcome to do so. For now, feel free to send an email to n.dombrowski@uva.nl with a markdown, quarto or text file with all relevant information and I can integrate this into the webpage. In the future, a “how-to-add-your-own-information” section will be added as well.\nOn each page, you will find a note if the software is installed on Crunchomics in the introduction. Additionally, each page will give you a brief installation instruction as well as some basic information about using the tool."

If you don’t have mamba/conda installed find the correction version for your system here for mamba and here for conda. Examples for setting up either mamba or conda are found in the code cell below.\nIf there is an issue with the mamba/conda installation, the software can also be downloaded with wget https://microbiology.se/sw/ITSx_1.1.3.tar.gz. After the download, decompress the folder and follow the information in the readme.txt. The download also comes with a test.fasta which can be used to test either installation.\n\n\n\n#install conda (run only if not yet installed)\n#adjust the file name based on your system needs\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\nbash Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n#install mamba (run only if not yet installed)\n#adjust the file name based on your system needs\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\nbash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n\n\n\n\nmamba create -n fungi_its\nmamba install -n fungi_its -c bioconda itsx\nmamba deactivate\nmamba activate fungi_its\n\n\n\n\n\nmamba install -c bioconda itsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired input: FASTA format (aligned or unaligned, DNA or RNA)\nGenerated output:\n\none summary file of the entire run\none more detailed table containing the positions in the respective sequences where the ITS subregions were found\none “semi-graphical” representation of hits\none FASTA file of all identified ITS sequences\none FASTA file for the ITS1 and ITS2 regions\nif entries that did not contain any ITS region are found, a list of sequence IDs representing those entries (optional)\n\nUseful arguments (not extensive, check manual for all arguments):\n\n--save_regions: Get all regions of interest, not only ITS1/2\n-E {value}: E-value cutoff (default 1e-5)\n-S {value}: Domain score cutoff (default 0)\n--cpu {value }: Number of cpus to use (default 1)\n--multi_thread {T/F}: Multi-thread the HMMER-search.
