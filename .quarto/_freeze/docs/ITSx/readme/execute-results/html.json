If you don't have mamba/conda installed find the correction version for your system here for [mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) and here for [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Examples for setting up either mamba or conda are found in the code cell below.\n\nIf there is an issue with the mamba/conda installation, the software can also be downloaded with `wget https://microbiology.se/sw/ITSx_1.1.3.tar.gz`. After the download, decompress the folder and follow the information in the readme.txt. The download also comes with a test.fasta which can be used to test either installation.\n\n\n### Install mamba/conda\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n#install conda (run only if not yet installed)\n#adjust the file name based on your system needs\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\nbash Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n#install mamba (run only if not yet installed)\n#adjust the file name based on your system needs\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\nbash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Option A (install ITSx in a separate environment)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nmamba create -n fungi_its\nmamba install -n fungi_its -c bioconda itsx\nmamba deactivate\nmamba activate fungi_its\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Option B (base ITSx install)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nmamba install -c bioconda itsx\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\n- Required input: FASTA format (aligned or unaligned, DNA or RNA)\n\n- Generated output:\n  - one summary file of the entire run \n  - one more detailed table containing the positions in the respective sequences where the\nITS subregions were found\n  - one \"semi-graphical\" representation of hits \n  - one FASTA file of all identified ITS sequences\n  - one FASTA file for the ITS1 and ITS2 regions\n  - if entries that did not contain any ITS region are found, a list of sequence IDs\nrepresenting those entries (optional)\n\n- Useful arguments (not extensive, check manual for all arguments):\n  - `--save_regions`: Get all regions of interest, not only ITS1/2\n  - `-E {value}`: E-value cutoff (default 1e-5)\n  - `-S {value}`: Domain score cutoff (default 0) \n  - `--cpu {value }`: Number of cpus to use (default 1)\n  - `--multi_thread {T/F}`: Multi-thread the HMMER-search. On (T) by default if the number of CPUs/cores is larger than one (--cpu option > 1), else off (F)\n  - `--preserve {T/F}`: If on, ITSx will preserve the sequence headers from the input file instead of replacing them with ITSx headers in the output. Off (F) by default.\n  - `--only_full {T/F}`: If true, the output is limited to full-length ITS1 and ITS2 regions only. Off (F) by default.\n  - `--minlen {value}` Minimum length the ITS regions must be to be outputted in\nthe concatenated file (see --concat above). Default is zero (0).\n\n\n### Example code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n#activate the right environment (if using environment)\nmamba deactivate\nmamba activate fungi_its\n\n#testrun (adjust path of test.fasta to where ever you downloaded the software)\nmkdir testing\nITSx -i software/ITSx_1.1.3/test.fasta --save_regions all -o testing/ITS_test_v1\n\n#sanity checking\ngrep -c \">\" *fasta\n\n#deactivate environment (if using environment)\nmamba deactivate\n```\n:::\n\n\nRegions extracted from test file (notice how the full fasta ONLY contains sequences with all regions):\n\n- ITS_test_v1.5_8S.fasta:50\n- ITS_test_v1.ITS1.fasta:50\n- ITS_test_v1.ITS2.fasta:50\n- ITS_test_v1.LSU.fasta:32\n- ITS_test_v1.SSU.fasta:31\n- ITS_test_v1.full.fasta:19\n\n\n",
