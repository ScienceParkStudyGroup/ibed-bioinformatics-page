If you don't have mamba/conda installed find the correction version for your system here for [mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) and here for [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Examples for setting up either mamba or conda are found in the code cell below.\n\nIf there is an issue with the mamba/conda installation, the software can also be downloaded with `wget https://microbiology.se/sw/ITSx_1.1.3.tar.gz`. After the download, decompress the folder and follow the information in the readme.txt. The download also comes with a test.fasta which can be used to test either installation.\n\n\n### Install mamba/conda\n\n```{bash}\n#install conda (run only if not yet installed)\n#adjust the file name based on your system needs\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\nbash Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n#install mamba (run only if not yet installed)\n#adjust the file name based on your system needs\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\nbash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh\n```\n\n### Option A (install ITSx in a separate environment)\n\n```{bash}\nmamba create -n fungi_its\nmamba install -n fungi_its -c bioconda itsx\nmamba deactivate\nmamba activate fungi_its\n```\n\n### Option B (base ITSx install)\n\n```{bash}\nmamba install -c bioconda itsx\n```\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\n- Required input: FASTA format (aligned or unaligned, DNA or RNA)\n\n- Generated output:\n  - one summary file of the entire run \n  - one more detailed table containing the positions in the respective sequences where the\nITS subregions were found\n  - one \"semi-graphical\" representation of hits \n  - one FASTA file of all identified ITS sequences\n  - one FASTA file for the ITS1 and ITS2 regions\n  - if entries that did not contain any ITS region are found, a list of sequence IDs\nrepresenting those entries (optional)\n\n- Useful arguments (not extensive, check manual for all arguments):\n  - `--save_regions`: Get all regions of interest, not only ITS1/2\n  - `-E {value}`: E-value cutoff (default 1e-5)\n  - `-S {value}`: Domain score cutoff (default 0) \n  - `--cpu {value }`: Number of cpus to use (default 1)\n  - `--multi_thread {T/F}`: Multi-thread the HMMER-search. On (T) by default if the number of CPUs/cores is larger than one (--cpu option > 1), else off (F)\n  - `--preserve {T/F}`: If on, ITSx will preserve the sequence headers from the input file instead of replacing them with ITSx headers in the output. Off (F) by default.\n  - `--only_full {T/F}`: If true, the output is limited to full-length ITS1 and ITS2 regions only. Off (F) by default.\n  - `--minlen {value}` Minimum length the ITS regions must be to be outputted in\nthe concatenated file (see --concat above). Default is zero (0).\n\n\n### Example code\n\n```{bash}\n#activate the right environment (if using environment)\nmamba deactivate\nmamba activate fungi_its\n\n#testrun (adjust path of test.fasta to where ever you downloaded the software)\nmkdir testing\nITSx -i software/ITSx_1.1.3/test.fasta --save_regions all -o testing/ITS_test_v1\n\n#sanity checking\ngrep -c \">\" *fasta\n\n#deactivate environment (if using environment)\nmamba deactivate\n```\n\nRegions extracted from test file (notice how the full fasta ONLY contains sequences with all regions):\n\n- ITS_test_v1.5_8S.fasta:50\n- ITS_test_v1.ITS1.fasta:50\n- ITS_test_v1.ITS2.fasta:50\n- ITS_test_v1.LSU.fasta:32\n- ITS_test_v1.SSU.fasta:31\n- ITS_test_v1.full.fasta:19\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"paged","error":false,"eval":false,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"embed-resources":true,"toc-depth":3,"output-file":"readme.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"code-block-bg":true,"code-block-border-left":"#31BAE9"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
