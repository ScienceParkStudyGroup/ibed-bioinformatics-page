## Setting up a terminal

Below you find some links that help you in setting up a Bash command line depending on your operating system:

### Linux

The default shell is usually Bash and there is usually no need to install anything to be able to follow this tutorial. 

### Mac

To access the Unix command prompt on a Mac operating system, open the Terminal application. It is located by default inside the Utilities folder, which in turn is inside the Applications folder, i.e., /Applications/Utilities/ folder. Alternatively, you can find the terminal application by using the spotlight search tool.

### Windows

Operating systems like macOS and Linux come with a native command-line terminal, making it straightforward to run bash commands. However, for Windows users you need to install some software first to be able to use bash.

One option to access the bash shell commands is using Git Bash, for detailed installation instructions please have a look at the [carpenties website](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell-windows).

A second option is Mobaxterm, which enables Windows users to execute basic Linux/Unix commands on their local machine, connect to an HPC with SSH and to transfer files with SCP/SFTP (more on that later). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://hpc.ncsu.edu/Documents/mobaxterm.php).

A final option is to use Windows and Linux at the same time on a Windows machine. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets users install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, which is the default Linux distribution, which we recommend to use) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows. This option allows you to use all the tools available but since you more or less are installing a separating system on your PC needs to have enough memory to run this. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).


After you set everything up and opened a terminal you should see something like this and are good to go if you want to follow the tutorial:
