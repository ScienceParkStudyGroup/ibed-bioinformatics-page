        "\n",
        "\"ITSx is an open source software utility to extract the highly variable ITS1 and ITS2 subregions from ITS sequences, which is commonly used as a molecular barcode for e.g. fungi.\" \n",

        "\n",
        "ITSx can be installed from scratch but below is the code needed to install the software with mamba (or conda if that is preferred). If you don't have mamba/conda installed find the correction version for your system here for [mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) and here for [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Examples for setting up either mamba or conda are found in the code cell below.\n",

        "If there is an issue with the mamba/conda installation, the software can also be downloaded with `wget https://microbiology.se/sw/ITSx_1.1.3.tar.gz`. After the download, decompress the folder and follow the information in the readme.txt. The download also comes with a test.fasta which can be used to test either installation.\n",
