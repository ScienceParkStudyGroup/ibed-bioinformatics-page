## NanoClass

### Introduction

NanoClass is a snakemake workflow developed by IBED's former biofinformatician Evelien Jongepier.

NanoClass is a taxonomic meta-classifier for meta-barcoding 16S rRNA gene sequencing data generated with the Oxford Nanopore Technology. With a single command, this Snakemake pipeline installs all programs and databases and runs and evaluates 10 popular taxonomic classification tools.
