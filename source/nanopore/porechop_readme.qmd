## Porechop

### Introduction

[Porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) is a tool for finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads. Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in its middle, it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads. Porechop performs thorough alignments to effectively find adapters, even at low sequence identity. 

Notice: From 2018 on, porechop is not actively maintained anymore. It runs perfectly fine, but that is something to keep in mind when running into bugs.

Available on Crunchomics: Not by default

### Installation

It is easiest to install porechop with conda. If you do not have mamba (or conda) installed. Check out the installation instructions for [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html#mamba-install) and [conda](https://crunchomics-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Mamba is a newer version of conda and from experience faster but since its newer this might mean that not all software can yet be installed with mamba.

```{bash}
mamba create --name porechop -c conda-forge -c bioconda porechop=0.2.4
```


### Usage

::: {.callout-important}
Adaptor trimming very much depends on how the sequencing library was generated.
Therefore, I recommend to carefully read through the [How it works section](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) of the softwares manual to know what to expect and look out for. 

Similarly, porechop works with both demultiplexed and non-demultiplexed sequences. Also here, the manual explains in more detail how to perform barcode demultiplexing.

Required input:

- FASTA/FASTQ of input reads or a directory which will be recursively searched for FASTQ files (required and can be fasta,fastq,fasta.gz,fastq.gz)
    
Output:

- FASTA or FASTQ of trimmed reads


Example code:

```{bash}
porechop --input myfile.fastq.gz \
  --output outputfolder/myfile_filtered.fastq.gz \
  --threads 1 \
  --discard_middle
```

Useful arguments (for the full version, check the manual):

- `-b` {BARCODE_DIR}, `--barcode_dir` {BARCODE_DIR}: Reads will be binned based on their barcode and saved to separate files in this directory (incompatible with --output)
- `--barcode_threshold` {BARCODE_THRESHOLD}
                                 A read must have at least this percent identity to a barcode to be
                                 binned (default: 75.0)
-  `--barcode_diff` {BARCODE_DIFF}    If the difference between a read's best barcode identity and its
                                 second-best barcode identity is less than this value, it will not
                                 be put in a barcode bin (to exclude cases which are too close to
                                 call) (default: 5.0)
- `--adapter_threshold` {ADAPTER_THRESHOLD}
                                 An adapter set has to have at least this percent identity to be
                                 labelled as present and trimmed off (0 to 100) (default: 90.0)
- `--check_reads `{CHECK_READS}      This many reads will be aligned to all possible adapters to
                                 determine which adapter sets are present (default: 10000)
- `--no_split`                     Skip splitting reads based on middle adapters (default: split
                                 reads when an adapter is found in the middle)
- `--discard_middle`               Reads with middle adapters will be discarded (default: reads with
                                 middle adapters are split) (required for reads to be used with
                                 Nanopolish, this option is on by default when outputting reads
                                 into barcode bins)
