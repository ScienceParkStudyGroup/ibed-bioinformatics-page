## General

In this section you find a set of tools useful to analyse sequencing data. Due to the increased popularity in long-read technologies, you can find a separate section for tools suitable for Nanopore analyses.

 Below you find a list of tutorials explaining how assemble and bin metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from short-read sequencing data and how to analyse these MAGS. Notice: These tutorials were not developed at UvA and will be updated in the future but will nevertheless give a good starting point into these kind of analyses.
